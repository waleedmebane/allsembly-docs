<img alt="_images/00empty_graph.png" src="_images/00empty_graph.png" />
<p>Click the button “Add Initial Position” to get started.</p>
<img alt="_images/01initial_position_dialog.png" src="_images/01initial_position_dialog.png" />
<p>An initial position is a position that is being taken, which is expected
to be the conclusion under consideration.  Enter the text of the
position being taken, then press “OK”.</p>
<img alt="_images/02initial_position_dialog_filled.png" src="_images/02initial_position_dialog_filled.png" />
<img alt="_images/03graph_mortal.png" src="_images/03graph_mortal.png" />
<p>The position appears in the diagram.  It is annotated above with
50.0% because there is no information pro or con to influence the estimate
of the probability of the position being true or correct.  Fifty percent
means indifference between true and false, correct and incorrect.</p>
<p>The diagram may be moved around by clicking and dragging it with the mouse
and zooming in and out may be accomplished with a mouse scroll wheel.
Additional controls for panning and zooming are intended for a future version.
Currently, the panning is a bit buggy.  If the diagram disappears from view,
you can get it back by loading the page again.  Just press enter in the
location line after the URL.</p>
<img alt="_images/04mortal_position_detail.png" src="_images/04mortal_position_detail.png" />
<p>Clicking on a position opens the position detail dialog box.
Currently this only contains the full text of the position and
buttons showing the actions that may be taken with respect to the
position.  The only action available in this version is “Argue”,
which means to present a pro or con consideration or piece of
evidence supporting or opposing the position.</p>
<p>The greyed out buttons are actions that will be available in future
revisions of the software.  “Define” means to clear up the meanings of
terms in the position.  “Discuss” means to start or add to an informal
discussion about the position.  Discussions are expected to be useful
for coming up with good arguments or good definitions of terms.  “Bet”
means to place a bet on whether the weight of evidence will support
the position in the end (pro considerations outweight con considerations).
“Relate” means to propose that the positon is related to some other
position by being either the same as the other position or mutually
exclusive with it.  This will enable the computer to model dependencies
between positions so as not to over or under count their weights in the
probability estimate.</p>
<img alt="_images/05argue_mortal.png" src="_images/05argue_mortal.png" />
<p>Pressing the “Argue” button opens the argue dialog box.  Premises are
the reasons or evidence you are contributing that supports or opposes
the position.  It is supposed to support the position when the
selected “Argument type” is “Pro” and to oppose the position when the
selected “Argument type” is “Con”.  Premises are themselves new positions.
When adding a premise, it is mandatory to give one’s estimate of the
probability of the truth or correctness of the premise in the form of
a bid.  A bid is an offer to buy a betting contract.  In a future
version of this software, bid orders will be filled when there is a
corresponding order pending at or below your bid price.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no interaction with other users in the software.
The system will accept whatever bid you put in.  So you can simulate
the case of a position stabilizing at a particular price.</p>
<p>After filling the fields, click “OK” to add your pro or con position
to the diagram.</p>
<img alt="_images/06argue_mortal_con_filled.png" src="_images/06argue_mortal_con_filled.png" />
<img alt="_images/07graph_mortal_plus_con.png" src="_images/07graph_mortal_plus_con.png" />
<p>The computer updates the probability estimates based on the prices of
the positions pro and con.  Since a “con” position was added, there is
only evidence against the position that “Achilles is mortal”, namely
that “Weapons do not wound him.”  Prices are between 0 and 100 “cents”.
A high price like 80 “cents” indicates high confidence in a position
among those who have bid.  High confidence in a “con” position lowers
the probability of the position it opposes.</p>
<img alt="_images/08mortal_plus_con_position_detail.png" src="_images/08mortal_plus_con_position_detail.png" />
<p>A new pro or con consideration may be added by clicking on the position
again.</p>
<img alt="_images/09mortal_argue_pro.png" src="_images/09mortal_argue_pro.png" />
<img alt="_images/10graph_mortal_plus_con_plus_pro.png" src="_images/10graph_mortal_plus_con_plus_pro.png" />
<p>A “pro” consideration has been added and the probability estimate is updated
by the computer software.  There is greater confidence in the “pro”
consideration than in the “con” consideration.</p>
<img alt="_images/11heel_position_detail.png" src="_images/11heel_position_detail.png" />
<p>In this step, we click on the position “His heel is vulnerable”, which we
will shore up with “pro” evidence.</p>
<img alt="_images/12argue_heel_pro.png" src="_images/12argue_heel_pro.png" />
<img alt="_images/13graph_mortal_complete_argument.png" src="_images/13graph_mortal_complete_argument.png" />
<p>We have the word of a reliable source according to the new “pro” evidence.
There is high confidence in that new position (95 “cents”).  The probability
evidence of the position it supports, “His heel is vulnerable”, has increased
and so has the probability estimate of the position supported by that position
(i.e., the initial position) that “Achilles is mortal”.</p>

<h3>Decision features<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the software is decision support, but no features for
specifically evaluating action or policy options have been added, yet.
Currently, the initial positions are not necessarily of the form:
we should do x (i.e., it would be in the common good to do x).</p>
<p>This section will be updated to include some information about what
the action or policy option evaluation features may look like and
how they might work.</p>
